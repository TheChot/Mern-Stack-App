//in lesson 8
we send the app to heroku but we command react to build
only when it is imported to heroku


In the tutorial we ran the two servers simutaneously but on heroku we
wont have access to the front end client
so a script is placed in the backend that will command heroku to look in the front 
end before the backend unless it is hitting a specific route...

allows the app to work on firefox without dev tools
window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ ? window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__() : f => f

to send the body of a post request with postman
go to headers tab
set key to content type
set the value to application/json
then go to the body and create an object
